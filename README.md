5. Reviews and Ratings: Users can leave reviews and ratings for campgrounds they have visited. These reviews often include a rating scale (e.g., out of 5 stars) and a text-based review.
6. Interactive Maps: Campground listings may include interactive maps showing the location of each campground.
7. Search and Filtering: Users can search for campgrounds based on various criteria such as location, amenities, or user ratings. Filtering options allow users to narrow down their search results.
